<h1>The DaisyDuck project</h1>
<p>
Welcome on the DaisyDuck project website, a free software for playing digital
audio books (Daisy 2.02).
</p>
<p>
The goal of this project is to provide the playback of online books and the
playback of local books (reachable directly on a physical media). The interface
is simplified for a quick handling, even for people with an handicap like
partially sighted persons.<br/>
Intuitive keyboard shortcuts provide an easy way in order to access the
functionalities of the application and in order to navigate in the books (by
chapter and by paragraph). DaisyDuck saves automatically the position where
the playback of a book was interrupted. Then, when this book is reloaded, the
start of the playback begins on the last position, without any action of the
auditor.

<h1>Project origins</h1>
<p>
This project was created by a member of the
<a href="http://www.geexbox.org">GeeXboX</a> team (which is the reason why the
project is hosted on the GeeXboX server), for his
"<a href="http://www.servicecivil.ch/pgs/scbref.html">non-military
national service (fr)</a>"; and in particular for the auditors of the
"<a href="http://www.bsr-lausanne.ch">Biblioth√®que Sonore Romande (fr)</a>" in
Lausanne. The online books playback was one of the main goals for this work.
Nevertheless the application can be used for playing Daisy 2.02 in their common
format.
