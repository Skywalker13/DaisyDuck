        <h1>For the developers</h1>
        <p>
          The DaisyDuck project concerns two different projects. The graphical
          interface (DaisyDuck) is separated of the Daisy files parser
          (libduck). DaisyDuck is written in C++ whereas libduck is written in
          C.
        </p>
        <h2>DaisyDuck</h2>
        <p>
          DaisyDuck is based on the Qt libraries. Excepted for the audio
          playback which is done by libVLC, and the handling of the Daisy 2.02
          files, which is done by libduck. This software is under the GPL3+
          license.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Qt4 :
            <a href="http://qt.nokia.comi/downloads"
              >http://qt.nokia.com/downloads</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            libVLC :
            <a href="http://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc.html"
              >http://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc.html</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>libduck</h2>
        <p>
          The parsing of Daisy 2.02 files, NCC and SMIL is fully done by
          libduck. This library is under the LGPL2.1+ license. Although all
          Daisy 2.02 files should be readable, all parts of the specifications
          are not supported. This library was written mainly for the graphical
          DaisyDuck application. So, the particularities like the XHTML files
          support (tag &lt;text&gt; in the SMIL files) are just ignored.<br />
          Even for a part of the metadata provided by the Daisy 2.02 files. Only
          the fields used by DaisyDuck (in principle) are getable with the
          public API of the library. Note that it is easy to add more metadata,
          if necessary. The parsing is done with the help of libxml2.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            libxml2 :
            <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html"
              >http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The work on libduck is inspired by the libdaisy library of "<a
            href="http://developer.skolelinux.no/info/studentgrupper/2006-hig-daisyplayer/"
            >The DaisyPlayer Project</a
          >".
        </p>
        <h1>The sources / Git</h1>
        <p>
          The sources are available online with the help of Git, a distributed
          revision control system, similar in purpose to tools such as Hg, CVS,
          SCCS, SVN and Arch. It is used to keep track of the changes made in
          the sources and to help programmers combine and otherwise manipulate
          changes made by multiple people or at different times.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are currently two ways of accessing to the Git tree. Via the
          command line or (to just have a look to some changes on a specific
          file, for example) via the web interface with your Internet browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/Skywalker13/DaisyDuck">daisyduck</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/Skywalker13/libduck.git">libduck</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to access to Git via command line, do the following (be sure
          that you have installed the git package).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To get a copy of every Git repository :
            <pre class="sh">
git clone https://github.com/Skywalker13/libduck.git</pre
            >
            <pre class="sh">
git clone https://github.com/Skywalker13/DaisyDuck.git</pre
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            To update your local copy of a repository, synchronizing with the
            server :
            <pre class="sh">git pull</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Compilation</h2>
        <p>
          The compilation of libduck and of DaisyDuck is made with the usual
          means via the `make` command (as well the building for GNU/Linux as
          for Windows). Although DaisyDuck is based on Qt4, the Makefiles do not
          depend of `qmake` and this one must not be used.
        </p>
        <pre class="sh">
 ./configure
 make
 make install </pre
        >
        <p>
          To make a cross-compilation, nothing difficult (example for Windows):
        </p>
        <pre class="sh">
 ./configure --cross-compile --cross-prefix=i586-mingw32msvc- --prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc
 make
 make install </pre
        >
        <p>
          The configure script strongly relies on pkg-config. In the particular
          case of Qt4 with DaisyDuck, check that the .pc files for QtCore,
          QtGui, QtXml and QtNetwork are available. Otherwise, you must pass all
          necessary arguments CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS or else you must create the
          pkg-config files manually.<br />
          According to your system settings, it can be necessary to proceed in
          this way (and especially in the case of Windows cross-compilation) :
        </p>
        <pre class="sh">
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc/lib/pkgconfig
 export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc/lib
 ./configure --cross-compile --cross-prefix=i586-mingw32msvc- --prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc
 make
 make install </pre
        >
        <p>
          If the configure script fails, look the config.log file which was
          generated in the root of the sources.
        </p>
