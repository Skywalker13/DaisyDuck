        <h1>The DaisyDuck project</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome on the DaisyDuck project website, a free software for playing
          digital audio books (Daisy 2.02).
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to provide the playback of online books
          and the playback of local books (reachable directly on a physical
          media). The interface is simplified for a quick handling, even for
          people with an handicap like partially sighted persons.<br />
          Intuitive keyboard shortcuts provide an easy way in order to access
          the functionalities of the application and in order to navigate in the
          books (by chapter and by paragraph). DaisyDuck saves automatically the
          position where the playback of a book was interrupted. Then, when this
          book is reloaded, the start of the playback begins on the last
          position, without any action of the auditor.
        </p>

        <h1>Project origins</h1>
        <p>
          This project was created by a member of the
          <a href="http://www.geexbox.org">GeeXboX</a> team (which is the reason
          why the project is hosted on the GeeXboX server), for his "<a
            href="http://www.servicecivil.ch/pgs/scbref.html"
            >non-military national service (fr)</a
          >"; and in particular for the auditors of the "<a
            href="http://www.bsr-lausanne.ch"
            >Biblioth√®que Sonore Romande (fr)</a
          >" in Lausanne. The online books playback was one of the main goals
          for this work. Nevertheless the application can be used for playing
          Daisy 2.02 in their common format.
